        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing technology, akin to the internet and smartphones, with tools like GitHub Copilot enhancing developer productivity. However, LLMs alone are unpredictable and prone to errors. Effective utilization requires an ecosystem of tools and methodologies, including prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, and conversational memory, to maximize their potential and economic impact.",
