What are the best practices for managing API keys and authentication?,"The article explains best practices for managing API keys and authentication, including storing keys securely using environment variables, rotating keys regularly, using least privilege principles, and monitoring usage. It also covers implementing OAuth for secure access and using API gateways for added security and rate limiting.",False,"Encountering rate limit errors like ""429: Too Many Requests"" when using the OpenAI API indicates exceeding the allowed request rate. Rate limits protect against abuse, ensure fair access, and manage server load. To avoid these errors, implement throttling strategies, such as those demonstrated in the provided example script. For more details, consult OpenAI's rate limit resources and consider requesting a rate limit increase if necessary.",0.4022188546790614,How can I request a rate limit increase?,no,"4
